**Task 7, further exposure to JS, introduction to arrays and common array methods, arrow function notation, call back functions, promises and classes, and JSON notation**

- Task 1, as shown in the attached image, given an array check for some conditions, I have put my tweak on it giving user the ability to input any array, and edit/delete items.
- Task 2, when user selects a band a select menu pops up with it's singers, choosing a singer from it results in new tab that redirects to that singer's website.

**Website is fully responsive, and suits mobile and pc**
